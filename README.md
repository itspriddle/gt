# GeekTool Scripts

This is just a small collection of GeekTool scripts I've found on the web. If you have any others, please fork and send me a pull request.

## Notes

To keep things easy, I put this repo in /usr/local/lib/geektool, then use that path within GeekTool.

## Resources

A few links I found some of these scripts at. If you know of any others, fork and add to this readme, or contact @itspriddle on Twitter.
